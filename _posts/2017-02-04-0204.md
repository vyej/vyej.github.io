# Ages of Madness/Magic
  These books have little to no interaction with Age of Expansion, and can be read at any point after Life Goes On. For this reason, a separate reading list is best for these Ages. Also, the specified continuity does not quite fit, as the age is specifically starting in Liberation's author's notes, while Madness Unleashed starts WWDE+200, meaning that at least 40 years are missing.

## Age of Madness
Madness Unleashed (Live Free or Die #1) - WWDE+200 years
Madness Rising (Live Free or Die #2)
Escaping Madness (Live Free or Die #3) - days after book 1
The Line Unbroken (Birth of Magic #1) - WWDE+210 years
Walk The Line (Birth of Magic #2) -WWDE +214 years
Dawn of Chaos (The Caitlin Chronicles #1)
Into the Fire (The Caitlin Chronicles #2)
Hunting the Broken (The Caitlin Chronicles #3)
The City Revolts (The Caitlin Chronicles #4)
Chasing the Cure (The Caitlin Chronicles #5)
End of the Line (Birth of Magic #3) WWDE + 235 years

## Age of Magic
Several of these stories appear to occur somewhat concurrently, with little to no connection due to large distances.
